    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <section>I started my career 8 years ago in grocery retail working as a cashier for Hy-Vee. After I turned 18,
        I moved to the Aisle Online department and helped in fulfilling online orders and helped run the department
        after the department head left for the day. After an Assistant Manager position opened, I accepted the offer.
        I was an Assistant Manager until I got a call from a recruiter for Dollar General. I moved my career there 
        for 10 months. I then learned that the District Manager was going to transfer another Assistant from another
        store to replace me. After Dollar General, I then worked for Signature Retail Services. Signature Retail Services
        is a retail construction company sub-contracted by the Home Depot. The company was not a good fit, and for that reason
        I went to work for Kwik Shop as an Assistant Manager. Due to everyone returning to work after Covid, we were going to 
        get a pay cut that wouldn't have allow me to continue to pay my bills. I then heard about an opening with Aldi and applied.
        I applied and was hired as a Store Associate. In July of 2022, I was promoted to Lead Sales Associate. This is where I currently
        work.
